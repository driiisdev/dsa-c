# Data Structure and Algorithm in C

# Data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently

# Data Structure concepts:
# 1) Mathematical / logical models or Abstract data-types
# 2) Implementation

# Abstract Data Types (ADTs):- define data and operations but no implementation.

# dsa based on:
# 1- logical view
# 2- operations
# 3- cost of operations
# 4- implementation
